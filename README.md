# LeoMain-Documentation
Documentation for the LeoMain site on Shopify.

## Disclaimer
I am not a Liquid developer. The changes I've made are surface level changes. They are not intended to change with backend Shopify theme changes.

## Custom Components
Custom features on the home page:
- Box Calculator
- Image Slider
- Audio Comparison

The HTML/CSS for these features is in the Shopify frontend editor as custom components. Change these by going into Shopify theme editor and click on the component.

The JavaScript functionality can be found here:
- Go to the admin panel
- Click "Online Store" in the left side navigator
- Click the three dots next to "Customize"
- Click "Edit Code"
- Find "Advanced-Content.liquid" for Box Calculator, Audio Comparison, and Image Slider
- Find "main-product.liquid" for custom quantity calculator on the main product page
- Search the page for "LeoMain Custom Content"
